Revising the xv6 Scheduler

This practical is worth 6% of your year-end mark. It is due at the start of Week 11 and part of the marking will take place in Labs in Week 11 and Week 12. It is an exercise in changing the xv6 scheduler from a simple round-robin one, to one that also does a simple form of "load balancing"

The material for Practical 4 is contained in P4distr.tar (attached), which contains two markdown files containing instructions and background information. HTML versions of this files are attached here.

To submit, simply upload just the file proc.c to blackboard.
