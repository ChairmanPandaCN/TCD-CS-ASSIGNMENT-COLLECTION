1. Push c rendition of LCA

2. Using printf statements as tests for LCA

3. Learn markdown for this project

## 2019-10-1

1. Switch from vs code to visual studio for more c/c++ support.

2. Write check() to test the code.

## 2019-10-2

1. Open a new Branch for DAG

## 2019-10-16

1. The return result of LCA of DAG match the definition i defined

1. Add comments explaining how it works

## 2019-10-17

1. Proceed to add test code.

1. Spot and fix a major problem when writing tests.The previous approach forbids the possibility of that the value of second node been passed in to lca() is alphabetically greater than the first one.
